title: About
---

I am a senior undergraduate student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering
at the [University of Rochester](https://rochester.edu). I am broadly interested
in robotics and autonomous systems. This interest ranges throughout the
'robotics' stack: from motion planning and state estimation to manipulation and
human-robot interaction. I am currently a research assistant at the
[Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (RAIL)](www2.ece.rochester.edu/projects/rail)
at the University of Rochester, looking at the use of probabilistic graphical
models to infer distributions of parametrized controllers for underactuated robots.
