Welcome to my homepage!

About me
======
I am a senior undergraduate student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering
at the University of Rochester. I am broadly interested in robotics and
autonomous systems. This interest ranges throughout the 'robotics' stack: from
motion planning and state estimation to manipulation and human-robot interaction.
I am currently a research assistant at the
[Robotics and Artificial Intelligence](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/projects/rail/)
Laboratory (RAIL) at the University of Rochester, looking at the use of
probabilistic graphical models to infer distributions of parametrized
controllers for underactuated robots.
