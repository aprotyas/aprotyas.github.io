Hi, my name is Abrar.

I was born and raised in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I currently reside in Pittsburgh, PA, USA, working on autonomy developer tools at [Argo AI](https://www.argo.ai).

I made this website to capture some thoughts and make myself look smartâ„¢, neither of which have gone to plan.

In a previous life, I studied at the University of Rochester and investigated motion planning for underactuated robots.

When away from the computer, I enjoy petting cats, playing football, and exploring food. Send me food recs and I'll send you a cat pic in return.

## Blog?

I might occasionally write "blog" posts to (a) document an experience or
(b) document a quick hack. The latter will be for my own reference, but please
feel free to suggest better alternatives if you ever stumble upon these posts.
