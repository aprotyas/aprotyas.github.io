[![Build Status](https://github.com/aprotyas/aprotyas.github.io/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aprotyas/aprotyas.github.io/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Forked from [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/). Removed a bunch
of stuff since I am not an academician.

## Note to myself

Local website serving instructions: `bundle exec jekyll liveserve`

If you ever publish papers/give talks, check out the original template for
a publication/talks markdown generator. Also, uncomment the publications/talks
collection tags in `_config.yml` and revive the appropriate files in the
`_pages` and `_includes` folder for proper rendering.
