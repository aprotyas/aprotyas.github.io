  <h1>Encryption Device</h1>

  <p>This project was done in collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahinmghani/">Mahin Muhtasim Ghani</a>, as a part of
    the coursework for ECE112: Introduction to Logic Design, at the University of Rochester.
    The final circuit is shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, with more details following
    the figure.

  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>The device was made such that the output of the incoming bitstream is complemented
    once a set	of predetermined bits (110) is detected. This would be reset once a
    different set of predetermined bits (100) is detected, i.e. output of the encryption
    devices matches the inputs. The design was implemented in a <a href="http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=921">DE0-CV Board.</a>
  </p>

  <h2>Approach</h2>
  <p>Initially, a state graph and transition table was created for the device in hand.
    The appropriate state maps and Karnaugh maps (as shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>) were produced from the
    table, after which equations for the flip-flop inputs (D<sub>a</sub>, D<sub>b</sub>, D<sub>c</sub>) and the output
    (Z) were derived. These equations were used to produce the appropriate logical
    connections in the Intel Quartus Prime application, which was then compiled and programmed
    onto the DE0‚ÄêCV board, where the operation of the encryption device was verified. </p>

    <p>For the purposes of this lab, a push button (KEY[0]) was used to represent a clock
      input, a switch (SW[0]) was used to represent a bit input, and the logical output
      was mapped to LEDR[0]. </p>
