I am a senior undergraduate student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering
at the University of Rochester. I am broadly interested
in robotics and autonomous systems, and I'm trying to contribute to robotics
problems through the scientific process, software development, simulation, and
testing!

I will eventually get around to making some memory jogger posts on
<a href="blog/">blog</a>, but take your expectation and cut it in half...
